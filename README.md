=======
An Algorithm to Compute the Colored Jones Polynomial

Author: Jesse S. F. Levitt

Date: Sept 2017

Version: 1.0 
___________________________________________________________________ 

This is a Mathematica script to compute the Colored Jones polynomial using the Walk on braid model by Cody Armond refined from the work of Vu Huynh and Thắng Lê.

Full Installation instructions will be uploaded soon.

A brief tutorial will be uploaded eventually. 

If your computer does not have a C compiler use the ColorJonesNoCCode.wl file, otherwise the ColorJones.wl file is more efficient.
